         <p>The cosmos may not be broken after all. Soon after the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) started its science mission in 2022, astronomers discovered a half-dozen galaxies near the edge of the universe that appeared far more massive than anyone expected (see “Too big, too soon” in the September 2023.</p>
         <p>Prevailing theory held that the first galaxies were relatively small clouds of gas, stars, and dust that slowly grew into the majestic spirals and unassuming ellipticals that populate the universe today. But based on the amount of light these six galaxies were spewing into space, researchers estimated that each possessed at least 10 billion solar masses of material and one seemed to be 10 times more massive, or nearly the size of the Milky Way.</p>
         <p>The observations implied that these galaxies — all from a time less than 1 billion years after the Big Bang — were converting nearly 100 percent of their gas into stars. Cosmologists couldn’t figure out how this was possible — at least within the standard model of cosmology known as Lambda Cold Dark Matter. But the researchers, led by Ivo Labbé of the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, stressed that their results were preliminary, and that future, more detailed observations were needed to rule out other possibilities.</p>
